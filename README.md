# [Sangria][sangria] example template

This is a [Giter8][g8] template to assist prospective Sangria users in quickly setting up a service.
It comes with all the features that one would expect in a production project.
See [the generated project's documentation](src/main/g8/README.md) for details.
- a meaningful example domain model
- Web interfacing code for popular Scala libraries
- database interfacing code for popular Scala libraries and databases
- authentication and authorization
- automated project release versioning
- CI/CD pipeline code

The initial setup creates a project that uses
- an in-memory [H2][h2] database, populated with sample data;
- a database model generated by and interfaced to via [Slick][slick]; and
- JSON serialization via [Circe][circe].

A goal of the generated project is to be able to switch between the various supported implementations—of
Web interface, serialization format, database API library, etc.—using `sbt` variables,
avoiding the need to commit to a particular implementation.

## setup

Prerequisites:
- JDK 8
- sbt 1.3.x or higher

To create your own project, open a console and run the following command to apply this template:
 ```
sbt new performantdata/sangria-example.g8
 ```

This template will prompt for the following parameters. Press `Enter` if the default values suit you:
- `name`: Becomes the name of the project.
- `scala_version`: Specifies the Scala version for this project.
- `akka_http_version`: Specifies which version of Akka HTTP should be used for this project. Must be at least 10.2.0.
- `akka_version`: Specifies which version of Akka should be used for this project. Must be at least 2.6.0.
- `organization`: Specifies the organization for this project.

Once inside the project folder use the following command to run the code:
```
sbt run
```
