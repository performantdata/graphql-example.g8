# User data service

This project creates a [Sangria][sangria]-based service that provides access to a user database,
of the type that one might find in a social network.

## running the service
### local Docker

One can publish a local Docker image in the usual way (that [`sbt-native-packager`][sbt-native-packager] uses):
```shell
sbt docker:publishLocal
```
The server listens on port 8080. Deploy it in the usual way:
```shell
docker run -p 8080:8080 $name;format="normalize"$
```
Using the above port number, http://localhost:8080/graphql should return the GraphiQL UI when viewed from a browser.

## documentation

API documentation of the included classes is available in the usual way by running:
```shell
sbt doc
```

## implementation

Besides Sangria, the technologies used to implement the service include:

- [GraphiQL][graphiql], a Web-based UI for testing.

- [Liquibase][liquibase], for database schema generation and versioning.
  (This only works for JDBC-compatible databases.)
  There is [a change set file](src/main/resources/liquibase.xml) that can be modified by the user.

- [PureConfig][pureconfig], for software configuration.
- [Scala Logging][scala-logging], for logging API.
- [Log4J2][log4j2] with [YAML configuration](src/main/resources/log4j2.yaml), for logging backend.
- Docker image generation and publication

There are also points of variance, where a particular technology can be selected from those available:

- The Web interface may be provided by one of:
  - Akka HTTP

- The database may be one of:
  - [H2][h2]

Selection can be made in `build.sbt` using the available setting keys, e.g.:
```sbt
import SangriaExample._
database := H2
webApi := AkkaHttp
```
See the [`SangriaExample` class](project/SangriaExample.scala) for the available settings.

## updating the project

This project is generated from [a template][template].
The code in [`sangria.sbt`](sangria.sbt) and [the `sangria` directory](src/main/scala/$package;format="package-dir"$/sangria)
should not need to be changed by users of the template.
If that's _not_ true, point that out to the maintainers.

As such, one should be able to replace these files with those generated by a future version of the template
that's been given the same parameter values.
(This isn't a guarantee, but it is a secondary goal of the template project.)
